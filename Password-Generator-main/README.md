# Password-Generator
Generates a random password of the size inputted by the user
 I have uploaded two .c code files named as PasswordGen and PasswordGen2,
PasswordGen - It uses an array of characters from which the password will be chosen.
PasswordGen2- It converts the random no generated to its asci value character and uses it as password,
	      PS we've used n = rand()%65 + 65; because the alphabet a has the asci value of 65.
